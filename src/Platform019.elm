module Platform019 exposing (worker)

{-| In Elm 0.19, `programWithFlags` was renamed `worker`.
-}

import Platform exposing (Program, programWithFlags)


{-| Create a [headless] program with no user interface.

This is great if you want to use Elm as the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; for something
else. For example, you could send messages out ports to modify the DOM, but do
all the complex logic in Elm.

Initializing a headless program from JavaScript looks like this:

```javascript
var app = Elm.MyThing.init();
```
